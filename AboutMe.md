# hello-world
My first repository

My name is Igor. I born in 96. I have a master in business and I recently quitted my job as a foreign currency stock broker to be a dev. To me it was the right decision. Don't want to spend the entire day trying to sell things to people, just want to be me and my computer having a conversation.
